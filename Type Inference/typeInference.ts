// type inference refers to Typescripts compilers ability to infer types from certain values in your code.

// typescript can remember a values type even if you didn't provide a type annotation, and it will enforce that type moving forward

// EXAMPLE:
let x = 35
// x = "thirty six" --> Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
